# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# For the Backend 

`src` -> Inside the src folder all the actual source code regarding the project will reside, this will not include any kind of tests. (You might want to make separate tests folder)

Lets take a look inside the `src` folder

 - `config` -> In this folder anything and everything regarding any configurations or setup of a library or module will be done. For example: setting up `dotenv` so that we can use the environment variables anywhere in a cleaner fashion, this is done in the `server-config.js`. One more example can be to setup you logging library that can help you to prepare meaningful logs, so configuration for this library should also be done here. 

 - `routes` -> In the routes folder, we register a route and the corresponding middleware and controllers to it. 

 - `middlewares` -> they are just going to intercept the incoming requests where we can write our validators, authenticators etc. 

 - `controllers` -> they are kind of the last middlewares as post them you call you business layer to execute the budiness logic. In controllers we just receive the incoming requests and data and then pass it to the business layer, and once business layer returns an output, we structure the API response in controllers and send the output. 

 - `repositories` -> this folder contains all the logic using which we interact the DB by writing queries, all the raw queries or ORM queries will go here.

 - `services` -> contains the buiness logic and interacts with repositories for data from the database

 - `utils` -> contains helper methods, error classes etc.

### Setup the project

 - Download this template from github and open it in your favourite text editor. 
 - Go inside the folder path and execute the following command:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
 - In the root directory create a `.env` file and add the following env variables
    ```
        PORT=<port number of your choice>
    ```
    ex: 
    ```
        PORT=8000
    ```
 - go inside the `src` folder and execute the following command:
    ```
      npx sequelize init
    ```
 - By executing the above command you will get migrations and seeders folder along with a config.json inside the config folder. 
 - If you're setting up your development environment, then write the username of your db, password of your db and in dialect mention whatever db you are using for ex: mysql, mariadb etc
 - If you're setting up test or prod environment, make sure you also replace the host with the hosted db url.

 - To run the server execute
 ```
 npm run dev
 ```
